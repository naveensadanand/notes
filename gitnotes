What is Git?
Git is a software which keeps track of changes that you make in files and directory.
-especially test changes, 
-version 1, version 2, version 3
git can track/manager above version, can allow you to move back and forth version also allows you to check diff between those versions.

Since it manages versions, so it also called Version control system (VCS).

VCS can be used to Source code management (SCM).

Git is distributed Version control.
--Different users (or teams of users) each maintain their own repositories, instead of working from central repository.
--changes are stored as "change sets" or "patches"
	-focus on tracking changes not version of the documents.
	-different from CVS and SVN, which track versions to versions.
	-change sets can be exchanged between repositories.
		-"merge-in change sets" or "apply patches"
--No single master repository, just many working copies
	-Each with their own combination of change sets.
--Imagine changes to a document as sets A,B,C,D,E,F
	-Repo 1: A,B,C,D,E,F
	-Repo 2: A,B,C,D
	-Repo 3: A,B,C,E
	-Repo 4: A,B,E,F
--No need to communicate with a central server
	-faster (communication is not required with a central server)
	-no network access required (since we are not making any communication with server).
