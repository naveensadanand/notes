What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is a software that allows continous integration. It is a powerful application that allows continuous integration and continuous delivery of projects, regardless of the platform you are working on. 
It is a free source that can handle any kind of build or continuous integration. You can integrate Jenkins with a number of testing and deployment technologies.

Below is the flow.
1. Developers check their source code.
2. Jenkins will pick up the changes source code and trigger a build and run(automate) any tests if required.
3. The build output will be available in the jenkins dashboards. Automatic notifications can also be sent back to the developer.

What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous Integration is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository at regular intervals. This concept was meant to remove the problem of finding later occurrence of issues in the build lifecycle. 
The common practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should be triggered.
